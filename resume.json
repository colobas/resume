I plan to do that via my very particular set of skills. I'm hardworking and resilient. I play for the team. I don't give up. When I'm not coding, hacking a project together, training a machine learning model, reading a book, cooking, running, travelling, playing some instrument, or spending time with my friends and family, I'm either sleeping or trying to.",
