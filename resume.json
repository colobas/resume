    "summary": "I usually say my life goal is to save the World. It might be too ambitious, so I'd already be happy if I could just make it a better place. I plan to do that via my very particular set of skills, both hard and soft. I'm hardworking and resilient. I play for the team. I don't give up. When I'm not coding, hacking a project together, training a model, reading a book, cooking, running, travelling, playing some instrument, or spending time with my friends and family, I'm either sleeping or trying to.",
